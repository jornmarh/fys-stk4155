This is the folder containing all work corresponding to project 2 in fys-stk4155 autumn 2021.
This directory consist of 2 subdirectories:
  - Code
  - Figures

In the folder code you will find the following files:
  - data_handling_plot: Script to perform the bar-graph in the methods section for the breast-cancer data
  - logReg.py: Script for logistic regression, task e)
  - module1.py and SGDRegression.py, these are part of the same exercise, as module1.py contain a class of SGD functions and other functionalities used in SGDRegression.py
  - ols.py: A scipt for ordinary least squares and ridge regression on the Franke-function. We used this to obtain data to compare to our other methods
  - nnClassification.py: This is a file containing the neural network for binary classification of the Wisconsin breast-cancer data
  - nnRegression.py: Similar to nnClassification.py, but for regression of Franke's functin.
  - plot_functions.txt: This text file contain the code corresponding to figures in the report on classification with our neural network. 

In the figures/ folder we have 4 subdirectories logReg/, nnClassification/, nnRegression/ and SGD corresponding to the different calculations of this project.

The main report for this project is called project_2_report.pdf
