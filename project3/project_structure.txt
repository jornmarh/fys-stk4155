			Datahandling
			
	- Check for absent values - essential (1st: Try by removing items)
	- Balance between classes - non essential (1st: Don't do anything)
	- Split to features/targets - essential (1st: split to body features, and specimen; leave out sex, age, island)
	- scale - non essential (1st: Don't do anything)
	- split train/test - essential (1st: Normal train test split with scikit; test_size=0.2)
	

			Experiemental work
First part of the project: (Put this in the method section)
- Datahandling, see above
- Plots/figures illustrating features of the data

Second part of the project: (Main part of the results)
- Predict specimen type(categorical) from body features only(nummeric) with first normal dTree, then more advanced trees and methods.
	- Leave out catecorical features
	- Leave out nan elements
	- Don't scale
	- Don't balance the classes


Third part of the project: (For discussion purposes)
- Other predictions
	- Sex?
	- Island?
	- Predict body mass from sex, island and penguin type? 
	- Etc, be creative
	
Forth part of the project: (For discussion/Conclusion)
- Compare results to other methods:
	- Neural nets from tensorflow/keras
	- Different datahandling:
		- scale
		- Balance
		- nan features
		


Do some sort of overfitting analysis, for instance bias variance tradeoff, or based on the pruning parameter alfa with a plot of train vs test data as a function of alpha. 

Methods:
- Single decision tree
- Bagging
- Random forest
- AdaBoost
- XDGboost



Results: 
	- Single decsion tree:
		- Optimization V
		- Accuracy score V
		- Confusion matrix V
		- Cumaltive gain curve V
		- ROC curve V
		- Precision-recall curve V
		- Bias variance tradeoff
		- Remember to cross-validate V
		- Visualize tree
